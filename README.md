# Dragon's Rampage

A single-file browser game where you play a dragon. Open `index.html`; it needs no build step and no server.

## Building from source
The source is split into parts, which are concatenated in this order:
```
cat part1.html partW.js partF.js part2.js part3.js part4.js part5.js part7.js partB.js partS.js partG.js part6.js > index.html
```
- part1.html: page shell, canvas and game state
- partW.js: the world (regions, terrain, rivers/lake, roads, decor, fog of war)
- partF.js: regional wildlife, mounted knights, patrols
- part2–5.js: dragon, units, kingdom AI, siege engines and drawing
- part7.js: input and gamepad
- partB.js: bridges and river pathing
- partS.js: the sea (swimming, sea life, boats, pirates, the giant squid, the Lonely Lighthouse)
- part6.js: main loop, HUD, minimap and world map, title screen

## The world
- The map is a large explorable kingdom with 12 regions: Kingdom Farmlands, Castle Aldric, The Deepwood (with the hunter's cabin), Mirror Lake & the Silver River, Frostpeak Mountains, the hills and Stone Mine, the Southern Farmlands, the Sapphire Coast, Dragon's Roost (your lair) and, out east, three sea regions: The Sapphire Sea, The Lonely Lighthouse and The Kraken Deep.
- Entering a region shows its banner, and finding a new region is worth +100.
- Unexplored land is hidden under fog. The minimap shows explored terrain, structures, units, patrols (shield icons, red when engaged), siege engines, gold, the princess and your lair. M / LB opens a full world map with region and village names and the explored %.
- Goal: raid the castle, stash gold in your lair, and fly the princess home (follow the gold arrow). The kingdom fights back with waves, the wanted meter, the hunter and bucket brigades, and it rebuilds.

## Hunger (normal mode only)
- A drumstick meter in the HUD (under Stamina) slowly empties: about 80 s from full to empty on the ground, and about 60 s at the fastest (flying and breathing fire).
- Eating any person, animal or bird refills it; bigger meals refill more (a chicken about 11, a villager 22, a cow 57, a bear 88). Resting at the lair heals you but does **not** feed you.
- Below 25 the meter flashes orange ("Getting hungry…"). At zero you are **Starving!**: the meter pulses red, a warning appears on screen, and you lose 2.5 HP/s until you eat again. Starving to death ends the game.
- Easy mode has no hunger at all (the meter is hidden).
- Hunger drains 1.4× faster while you swim or fly over water (sea, lake or river).

## The sea
- East of the coast is a big open sea. Fly over it, or land on any water (sea, Mirror Lake, the Silver River) to **swim**: you move at about half speed, regain stamina more slowly, cannot stomp, and sit half-submerged with ripples. Biting (E) and fire still work.
- **Sea life:** fish schools (a small snack per bite; fire just makes them dive), sharks (circle and nip you for 3; +20 HP), whales (slow; their tail slaps for 4; too big to swallow until worn down below half health; +75 HP).
- **The GIANT SQUID** lurks in **The Kraken Deep** (far east). It slams a tentacle where you are heading (dodge the red ring, 9 damage) or grabs you (3 HP/s; burn it to break free). Wear it down until it is **DAZED**, then eat it for +150 HP and +1500 points. It returns only after about 4 minutes.
- **Boats:** fishing boats, merchant ships (they flee and carry a little gold) and rowboats on the lake. Burn them, bite their hulls, or dive slam onto them. Sunk crews swim in the water and can be eaten.
- **Pirates:** cartoony skull-and-crossbones ships that circle you and fire crossbows (2) and arcing cannonballs (7; watch the red target ring), whether you are flying or swimming. They douse fires after a while, so keep burning! A sunk pirate ship leaves pirate swimmers and a floating gold chest (swoop low to collect it, then stash it at your lair).
- **The Lonely Lighthouse:** a rest-stop island just before the Kraken Deep, with a sweeping light beam and a map marker. Landing on it restores stamina fast and slowly heals you. The keeper and fishermen at the dock are edible and come back over time, and seals lounge on the rocks: they flop into the sea when you come near, are worth +24 HP, and respawn. Pirates rarely sail nearby.

## Wildlife (spawns and respawns only in its home region; bigger animals heal more)
- **Farmland:** cows, pigs, sheep, chickens, horses (in paddocks), crows
- **Forest:** deer, rabbits, boars, foxes, wolves (packs that nip back), bears (fight back harder, big heal)
- **Lake/river:** ducks, geese, jumping fish, beavers
- **Mountains/cliffs:** mountain goats, eagles, hawks
- **Coast:** seagulls, crabs, seals
- **Hills/mine:** goats

## Mounted knights
- Fast lance cavalry rides out of the castle gate. They charge in a straight line (the lance only hits a grounded dragon) and then wheel around for another pass.
- They are tougher than foot knights. Fire or a stomp dismounts the rider: the horse bolts and a foot knight is left behind.
- Horse and rider can be eaten for a big heal.
- They join waves from the archer tier, in bigger numbers later, and the wave banner lists them.

## Patrols
- Patrols roam the roads between villages, the castle and the camps, independent of the wanted meter. Each has a random mix of foot knights, archers and cavalry, plus a banner carrier.
- Later levels bring bigger, tougher patrols. The number of patrols is capped.
- They attack if you come close, and attacking them raises the wanted meter.

## Bridges
- Wooden bridges carry the roads over the Silver River. Burn one and it collapses into charred posts.
- Ground units, cavalry, patrols and siege engines can't cross a broken bridge. They detour to another bridge, or around the lake if every bridge is out.
- Villagers rebuild bridges in wood first. From level 3, with enough stone, they rebuild or upgrade them in stone. A progress bar shows the build.
- Stone bridges are fireproof but can be wrecked by repeated stomps (about 5) or heavy dive slams (about 4).
- Each wrecked bridge is worth +80.

## Graphics (High / Low)

On the title screen, pick the **Graphics** row with ↑/↓ and switch it with ←/→ or Enter, or press **G** anywhere on the title screen. The setting is saved in the browser (`localStorage` key `dr_gfx`). High is the default.

**High** ("cartoon realism"). All art is drawn in code, with no image files. Static art is cached in offscreen canvases.
- Dragon: gradient-shaded body with a scale pattern, belly plates, back ridge spikes, veined and scalloped wings, horns, glowing eyes and claws. It casts a soft shadow that shrinks and fades the higher it flies, and a wavy reflection over water.
- Terrain: textured grass tufts, flowers, pebbles, path grit, sand ripples and snow sparkle, baked once per 512 px chunk.
- Water: two moving caustic layers, breathing shore foam and sun glints.
- Trees: layered, shaded canopies that sway in the wind, with pines in the deep forest.
- Buildings: 2.5D houses, barns, barracks and cabins with lit and shaded roof slopes, chimney smoke and windows that glow at night. The castle has brick walls, round towers with cone roofs and flags, and glittering gold piles. Buildings lean slightly with the camera, for parallax.
- People have hair, eyes, rosy cheeks, belts and arms. Animals have fur, manes, spots and wool.
- Fire: additive flames, drifting embers, heat shimmer, an orange glow on the ground around fires and tall smoke plumes.
- Day and night: a full cycle every 5 minutes, with dusk tint, night darkness, warm light pools around fires, windows, torches and the lair, and the Lonely Lighthouse's rotating beam. Also a vignette and fire bloom.

**Low** keeps the original flat look. It has no day/night cycle and is the fastest choice for old machines.
